When you create a parameter mapping, you can use context variables as your data source. When you create mapping template transformations, you can use context variables, input, and util variables in scripts you write in [Velocity Template Language (VTL)](https://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/vtl-reference.html). For example mapping templates that use these reference variables, see [Examples using variables for mapping template transformations for API Gateway](./api-gateway-mapping-variable-examples.html).

For a list of reference variables for access logging, see [Variables for access logging for API Gateway](./api-gateway-variables-for-access-logging.html).

Context variables for data transformations


--------------------------------------------

You can use the following case-sensitive `$context` variables for data transformations.

Parameter

Description

`$context.accountId`

The API owner's AWS account ID.

`$context.apiId`

The identifier API Gateway assigns to your API.

`` $context.authorizer.claims.`property` ``

A property of the claims returned from the Amazon Cognito user pool after the method caller is successfully authenticated. For more information, see [Control access to REST APIs using Amazon Cognito user pools as an authorizer](./apigateway-integrate-with-cognito.html).

###### Note

Calling `$context.authorizer.claims` returns null.

`$context.authorizer.principalId`

The principal user identification associated with the token sent by the client and returned from an API Gateway Lambda authorizer (formerly known as a custom authorizer). For more information, see [Use API Gateway Lambda authorizers](./apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.html).

`` $context.authorizer.`property` ``

The stringified value of the specified key-value pair of the `context` map returned from an API Gateway Lambda authorizer function. For example, if the authorizer returns the following `context` map:

`"context" : {   "key": "value",   "numKey": 1,   "boolKey": true }`

Calling `$context.authorizer.key` returns the `"value"` string, calling `$context.authorizer.numKey` returns the `"1"` string, and calling `$context.authorizer.boolKey` returns the `"true"` string.

For `property`, the only supported special character is the underscore `(_)` character.

For more information, see [Use API Gateway Lambda authorizers](./apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.html).

`$context.awsEndpointRequestId`

The AWS endpoint's request ID.

`$context.protocol`

The request protocol, for example, `HTTP/1.1`.

###### Note

API Gateway APIs can accept HTTP/2 requests, but API Gateway sends requests to backend integrations using HTTP/1.1. As a result, the request protocol is logged as HTTP/1.1 even if a client sends a request that uses HTTP/2.

`$context.requestId`

`` $context.requestOverride.header.`header_name` ``

The request header override. If this parameter is defined, it contains the headers to be used instead of the **HTTP Headers** that are defined in the **Integration Request** pane. For more information, see [Override your API's request and response parameters and status codes for REST APIs in API Gateway](./apigateway-override-request-response-parameters.html).

`` $context.requestOverride.path.`path_name` ``

The request path override. If this parameter is defined, it contains the request path to be used instead of the **URL Path Parameters** that are defined in the **Integration Request** pane.

`` $context.responseOverride.header.`header_name` ``

The response header override. If this parameter is defined, it contains the header to be returned instead of the **Response header** that is defined as the **Default mapping** in the **Integration Response** pane. For more information, see [Override your API's request and response parameters and status codes for REST APIs in API Gateway](./apigateway-override-request-response-parameters.html).

`$context.responseOverride.status`

The response status code override. If this parameter is defined, it contains the status code to be returned instead of the **Method response status** that is defined as the **Default mapping** in the **Integration Response** pane.

`$context.webaclArn`

The complete ARN of the web ACL that is used to decide whether to allow or block the request. Will not be set if the stage is not associated with a web ACL. For more information, see [Use AWS WAF to protect your REST APIs in API Gateway](./apigateway-control-access-aws-waf.html).

Input variables


-----------------

You can use the following case-sensitive `$input` variables to refer to the method request payload and method request parameters. The following functions are available:

Variable and function

Description

`$input.body`

Returns the raw request payload as a string. You can use `$input.body` to preserve entire floating point numbers, such as `10.00`.

`$input.json(x)`

This function evaluates a JSONPath expression and returns the results as a JSON string.

For example, `$input.json('$.pets')` returns a JSON string representing the `pets` structure.

For more information about JSONPath, see [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) or [JSONPath for Java](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath).

`$input.params()`

Returns a map of all the request parameters. We recommend that you use `$util.escapeJavaScript` to sanitize the result to avoid a potential injection attack. For full control of request sanitization, use a proxy integration without a template and handle request sanitization in your integration.

`$input.params(x)`

Returns the value of a method request parameter from the path, query string, or header value (searched in that order), given a parameter name string `x`. We recommend that you use `$util.escapeJavaScript` to sanitize the parameter to avoid a potential injection attack. For full control of parameter sanitization, use a proxy integration without a template and handle request sanitization in your integration.

`$input.path(x)`

Takes a JSONPath expression string (`x`) and returns a JSON object representation of the result. This allows you to access and manipulate elements of the payload natively in [Apache Velocity Template Language (VTL)](https://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/vtl-reference.html).

For example, if the expression `$input.path('$.pets')` returns an object like this:

`[   {      "id": 1,      "type": "dog",      "price": 249.99    },    {      "id": 2,      "type": "cat",      "price": 124.99    },    {      "id": 3,      "type": "fish",      "price": 0.99    }  ]`

`$input.path('$.pets').size()` would return `"3"`.

For more information about JSONPath, see [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/) or [JSONPath for Java](https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath).

Stage variables


-----------------

You can use the following stage variables as placeholders for ARNs and URLs in method integrations. For more information, see [Use stage variables for a REST API in API Gateway](./stage-variables.html).

Syntax

Description

`` $stageVariables.`variable_name` ``, ``$stageVariables['`variable_name`']``, or ``${stageVariables['`variable_name`']}``

`variable_name` represents a stage variable name.

Util variables


----------------

You can use the following case-sensitive `$util` variables to use utility functions for mapping templates. Unless otherwise specified, the default character set is UTF-8.

Function

Description

`$util.escapeJavaScript()`

Escapes the characters in a string using JavaScript string rules.

###### Note

This function will turn any regular single quotes (`'`) into escaped ones (`\'`). However, the escaped single quotes are not valid in JSON. Thus, when the output from this function is used in a JSON property, you must turn any escaped single quotes (`\'`) back to regular single quotes (`'`). This is shown in the following example:

 ``"input" : "$util.escapeJavaScript(`data`).replaceAll("\\'","'")"``

`$util.parseJson()`

Takes "stringified" JSON and returns an object representation of the result. You can use the result from this function to access and manipulate elements of the payload natively in Apache Velocity Template Language (VTL). For example, if you have the following payload:

`{"errorMessage":"{\"key1\":\"var1\",\"key2\":{\"arr\":[1,2,3]}}"}`

and use the following mapping template

`#set ($errorMessageObj = $util.parseJson($input.path('$.errorMessage'))) {    "errorMessageObjKey2ArrVal" : $errorMessageObj.key2.arr[0] }`

You will get the following output:

`{    "errorMessageObjKey2ArrVal" : 1 }`

`$util.urlEncode()`

Converts a string into "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format.

`$util.urlDecode()`

Decodes an "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" string.

`$util.base64Encode()`

Encodes the data into a base64-encoded string.

`$util.base64Decode()`

Decodes the data from a base64-encoded string.
